                    2. How does forex trading work? Forex trading involves trading currency pairs, such as EUR/USD (Euro/US Dollar) or GBP/JPY (British Pound/Japanese Yen). Traders speculate on whether the value of a currency will rise or fall relative to the other currency in the pair. They make profits by buying a currency at a low price and selling it at a higher price, or vice versa.

                    5. What are the risks associated with forex trading? Forex trading involves risks, and it's important to be aware of them. Some common risks include: a. Market risk: Currency prices can be volatile and influenced by various factors such as economic indicators, geopolitical events, and central bank policies. b. Leverage risk: Forex trading often involves the use of leverage, which amplifies both profits and losses. While leverage can enhance potential gains, it can also lead to significant losses if not used responsibly. c. Counterparty risk: There is a risk that the broker you trade with may not fulfill its obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial difficulties. Choose a reputable and regulated broker to mitigate this risk. d. Operational risk: Technical issues, internet connectivity problems, or platform failures can disrupt your trading activities and result in losses.
